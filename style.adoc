== Programming Style

Programming is not a dry mechanical process, but a form of art. Well written
code has an aesthetic appeal while poor form can make other programmers and
instructors cringe. Programming assignments will be graded based on style and
correctness. Good programming practices usually include many of the following
principles:

* A comment at the top of the program that includes:

** Program authors

** Date or Dates

** A brief description of what the program does

* Concise comments that summarize major sections of your code

* Meaningful variable and function names

* Function comments that include:

. description of what function does

. description of input value(s) (parameter values)

. description of return value

* Well organized code

* White space or comments to improve legibility

* Avoidance of large blocks of copy-pasted code
